# aoc2018

Advent of Code 2018 - FSharp

## Requiremets

[.Net Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).  I developed/tested on Windows and Linux, shouldn't matter.

## Usage

```
C:\> git clone https://github.com/deciduously/aoc2018
C:\> cd aoc2018
C:\aoc2018> dotnet build
C:\> cd src\App
C:\aoc2018\src\App> dotnet run day1
```

Accepts arguments like `day1`, `day2`, and will let you know if a day isn't implemented.
